Frappe Helm Chart v8.0.0 Upgrade Notice: Important Changes to MariaDB

=============================================================================
>>> ACTION REQUIRED BEFORE UPGRADING TO v8.0.0 <<<
=============================================================================

The Frappe Helm Charts are removing the deprecated Bitnami subcharts.

- v7.x.x: Bitnami MariaDB subchart was enabled BY DEFAULT.
- v8.0.0+: NO MariaDB dependency is enabled BY DEFAULT.

If you upgrade without explicitly enabling MariaDB, your deployment will fail
or be non-functional.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO ENABLE MARIA DB FOR v8.0.0+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You MUST explicitly set one of the following in your values.yaml:

1.  RECOMMENDED FUTURE OPTION (New StatefulSet-based MariaDB):
    Use the new dedicated chart option. This is the long-term replacement.
    New installations use this for in cluster MariaDB.

    mariadb-sts.enabled: true

2.  TEMPORARY SUPPORT OPTION (Deprecated Bitnami Subchart):
    Only use this if you are currently using bitnami subcharts and need time to transition.
    This WILL be removed later.

    mariadb.enabled: true
    # or
    mariadb-subchart.enabled: true

3.  EXTERNAL MARIA DB:
    If connecting to a cloud or externally managed MariaDB instance.

    mariadb.enabled: false
    # Configure your external connection details in README...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Failing to set a MariaDB option will result in a deployment error.
Please review your configuration before performing the upgrade.
